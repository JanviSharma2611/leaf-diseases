# leaf-diseases
This project is a leaf disease detection system that uses deep learning techniques, including transfer learning, to identify and classify 33 different types of leaf diseases. The model has been trained on a large dataset of images and is designed to help agricultural professionals and enthusiasts diagnose plant diseases in a fast and accurate manner. 

To use the model for leaf disease detection, follow these steps:
Make sure you have a Python environment set up with the necessary libraries installed. You can use the provided requirements.txt file to set up the required dependencies.
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run main.py
streamlit run main.py
